Suzuki (PhD), Kaneko, Matsumoto, and Yamaguchi (undergrads) gave oral presentations about their work at the [69th Ecological Society of Japan Tohoku](https://sites.google.com/view/esj-tohoku69) at Hirosaki University in Aomori. They received many insights for their future research from the other participants, and the undergrads had their first conference experience, which was very rewarding.
